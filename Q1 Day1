write a java method that recieves an array and flips its elements in a similar way to the following example:
original array: 1 2 3 4 5 6
resulted array: 4 5 6 1 2 3

the method returns the new array.
you may assume that the size of the original array is always even
you should solve this question twice:
-once by defining a temporary array within the function to help you out
-and once without defining any extra memory
in both cases the complexity should not exceed O(n) 
upload a java file that contains both versions of the method + a main method that tests both of them,
or you can show me the answer tmrw in the lecture lol
